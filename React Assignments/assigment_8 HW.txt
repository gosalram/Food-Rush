1.why  there is super(props)in the constructer function in class based componet  in react

	In React, when you create a class-based component, the constructor function is used to initialize the component. The `super(props)` call within the constructor is crucial for a few reasons:

1. **Inheritance**: React components extend from the `React.Component` class. When you create a subclass and use a constructor, you need to call `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class. This ensures that the component is correctly set up with all the properties and methods inherited from `React.Component`.

2. **Accessing `this.props`**: The `super(props)` call passes the `props` to the parent class’s constructor. This is important because it allows you to access `this.props` inside the constructor. Without this, `this.props` would be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to errors if you try to use props in the constructor.

Here is an example of a class-based component with a constructor:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // This calls the parent class's constructor with the props
    this.state = {
      // Initialize state here
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.someProp}</p>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Detailed Explanation

- **Calling `super()`**: When you use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass, you must call `super()` in the constructor before you can use `this`. This is a rule enforced by JavaScript, not just React. The `super()` function calls the constructor of the parent class, ensuring that the subclass is properly set up.

- **Passing `props` to `super()`**: By passing `props` to `super()`, you ensure that the parent class’s constructor receives the props, allowing the component to correctly handle the incoming props. This setup is important for lifecycle methods and any other initializations that depend on the props.

If you omit `super(props)` and just use `super()`, `this.props` will be undefined in the constructor, leading to potential bugs. Always pass `props` to `super()` when defining a constructor in a React class component to ensure proper initialization.

### Example of Potential Issue Without `super(props)`

```javascript
class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(); // Incorrect, props are not passed
    console.log(this.props); // Undefined
  }

  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.someProp}</div>;
  }
}
```

In this incorrect example, `this.props` would be undefined in the constructor, which could lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.

By following the correct pattern with `super(props)`, you ensure that your component is properly initialized and can reliably access `this.props` and `this.state` within the constructor.


2.  why async is used componetdidmount in class based componenet


In React class-based components, componentDidMount is a lifecycle method that is called once, immediately after a component is added to the DOM. It is often used to perform side effects such as data fetching, initializing libraries, or setting up subscriptions.

Using async in componentDidMount allows you to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API. The async keyword enables the use of await inside the method, which pauses the execution of the function until the awaited promise is resolved or rejected. This makes the code easier to read and maintain compared to using plain promises with .then() and .catch().


Benefits of Using async in componentDidMount

Readability: Using async/await makes the code look more like synchronous code, which is easier to read and understand. It eliminates the need for chaining .then() and .catch() calls, making the control flow more straightforward.

Error Handling: With async/await, you can use try/catch blocks for handling errors, which can be more intuitive and cleaner compared to handling errors with .catch().

Asynchronous Initialization: Many tasks such as data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or initializing third-party libraries are inherently asynchronous. Using async in componentDidMount allows you to await these tasks and ensures that the component state is updated correctly once the asynchronous operations are complete.
